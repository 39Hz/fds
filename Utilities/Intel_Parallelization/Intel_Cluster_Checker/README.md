# Intel Cluster Checker

In order to use Intel Cluster Checker, follow the user guide [here](https://software.intel.com/en-us/cluster-checker-user-guide-2019-beta). Included in this directory is an example nodefile. Note that nodes that were not operation at time of writing are commented out in the file, meaning that the nodefile should be updated to reflect which nodes are operational when the tool is used.
