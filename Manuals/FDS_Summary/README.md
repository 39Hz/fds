# FDS Summary Web Page

This directory contains a summary of a firebot run. The summary consists of FDS user guide and Verificaiton guide png
images and all of the manuals generated by firebot.  You may view the summary by opening the web page `index.html`
found in this directory.
If you use the -w option (for specifying a web directory) when running firebot, you may view the firebot summary 
from other computers.  At NIST, these files are then copied to 
/var/www/html/firebot and may be accessed using http://blaze.el.nist.gov/firebot

firebot copies all png image files generated for the FDS User and Verification guides
to the FDS_Summary/images subdirectory.
Many but not all of these images are displayed in the `index.html`
web page. To display other images, add links to the page `index_template.html` and rerun firebot.
In addition to copying image files and guides, 
firebot copies `index_template.html` to `index.html` adding the current date, and FDS and SMV repo revisions.
