# FDS Summary Web Page

This directory contains web pages summarizing the results of a firebot run.
firebot copies all png image files generated for the FDS user and verification guides
to the images sub-directory many of which (but not all) are displayed in the `index.html`
web page. 

firebot also copies files in the FDS_Summary directory to a directory accessible 
to a web serverr making the web page accessible on other computers.  At NIST, the
firebot web page would be accessed using http://blaze.el.nist.gov/firebot
