# FDS Summary Web Page

This directory contains a summary of firebot run. You may view the summary by opening the web page index.html
in a web browser.
firebot copies all png image files generated for the FDS User and Verification guides
to the images/user and images/verification subdirectories.
Many but not all of these images are displayed in the `index.html`
web page. The page index_template.html may be edited to display other images contained in these subdirectories.
firebot copies index_template.html to index.html adding the current date, and FDS and SMV reppo revisions.
All of guides generated by firebot may also be viewed from index.html.

When the -w option is specified, firebot copies the FDS_Summary directory from this repo to a directory accessible 
to a web server allowing it to be accessed from other computers.  At NIST, these files are copied to 
/var/www/html/firebot and may be accessed using http://blaze.el.nist.gov/firebot
