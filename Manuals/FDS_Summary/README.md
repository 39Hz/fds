# FDS Summary Web Page

This directory contains web pages summarizing the results of a firebot run.
firebot copies all png image files generated for the FDS user and verification guides
to the images/user and images/verification subdirectories.
Many but not all of these images are displayed in the `index.html`
web page. The page index.html may be edited to display other images contained in these subdirectories.
In addition, all of guides generated by firebot are accessible from the manuals.html web page.

When the -w option is specified, firebot copies the FDS_Summary directory to a directory ( `/var/www/html/firebot` )accessible 
to a web server making these web pages accessible to other computers.  At NIST, these web pages may be accessed using http://blaze.el.nist.gov/firebot
